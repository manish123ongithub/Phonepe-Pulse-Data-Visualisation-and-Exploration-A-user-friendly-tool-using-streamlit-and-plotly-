Phonepe Pulse Data Visualization and Exploration
This project aims to create a user-friendly tool for visualizing and exploring data from Phonepe Pulse. Phonepe Pulse is a digital payments platform that provides real-time transaction data for merchants. The tool is built using Python, Pandas, MySQL, mysql-connector-python, Streamlit, and Plotly.

How to Use
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the necessary dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
Create a MySQL database and populate it with your transaction data.
Edit the config.ini file with your MySQL credentials and database information.
Run the app.py file using the command streamlit run app.py.
Open the browser and navigate to http://localhost:8501.
Features
The tool offers the following features:

Overview of transaction data, including total transactions, total revenue, and average transaction value.
A time series plot showing transaction volume and revenue over time.
Interactive bar charts and pie charts that allow users to explore transaction data by payment mode, payment instrument, and payment status.
A heat map that shows transaction volume and revenue by time of day and day of week.
A scatter plot that allows users to explore transaction data by transaction value and transaction count.
Limitations
The tool currently only supports data from a single merchant. Future updates may include the ability to analyze data from multiple merchants.
